# CommitLoom üßµ

> Weave perfect git commits with AI-powered intelligence

CommitLoom is an intelligent git assistant that helps you craft meaningful, structured commits. Like a master weaver's loom, it brings together all the threads of your changes into beautiful, well-organized commits.

## üöÄ Quick Start

1. Install CommitLoom via pip:

```bash
pip install commitloom
```

2. Set up your OpenAI API key:

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
# or create a .env file with OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key
```

3. Stage your changes with git:

```bash
git add .  # or stage specific files
```

4. Use CommitLoom to create your commit:

```bash
loom  # Interactive mode
# or
loom -y  # Non-interactive mode
```

## üìù CLI Usage

CommitLoom can be used in both interactive and non-interactive modes:

```bash
# Interactive mode (default)
loom

# Non-interactive mode (auto-confirm all prompts)
loom -y

# Combine all changes into a single commit
loom -c

# Enable verbose logging
loom -v

# Show help
loom --help
```

### CLI Options

- `-y, --yes`: Auto-confirm all prompts (non-interactive mode)
- `-c, --combine`: Combine all changes into a single commit
- `-v, --verbose`: Enable verbose logging
- `-h, --help`: Show help message

### Interactive Features

- Analyzes staged changes and suggests commit messages
- Handles large changes by splitting them into batches
- Provides warnings for complex changes
- Shows token usage and cost estimates
- Allows choosing between individual or combined commits

### Non-Interactive Features

- Perfect for CI/CD pipelines
- Automatically handles batching and commits
- Provides clear error messages
- Maintains high commit quality without user intervention

## üéØ Why CommitLoom?

Managing git commits can be challenging:
- Writing clear, descriptive commit messages takes time
- Large changes are hard to organize effectively
- Maintaining consistency across a team is difficult
- Binary files require special attention

CommitLoom solves these challenges by:
- Automatically generating structured commit messages
- Intelligently batching large changes
- Ensuring consistent commit style
- Providing clear insights about your changes

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

When you run `loom`, it:

1. üîç **Analyzes** your staged changes
2. üìä **Evaluates** complexity and size
3. ü§ñ **Generates** appropriate commit messages
4. üßµ **Organizes** changes into optimal batches if needed
5. üí° **Guides** you through the commit process

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

Configure via environment variables or `.env` file:

```env
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key

# Optional with defaults
TOKEN_LIMIT=120000
MAX_FILES_THRESHOLD=5
COST_WARNING_THRESHOLD=0.05
MODEL_NAME=gpt-4o-mini  # Default and most cost-effective model
```

### ü§ñ Model Configuration

CommitLoom supports various OpenAI models with different cost implications:

| Model | Description | Cost per 1M tokens (Input/Output) | Best for |
|-------|-------------|----------------------------------|----------|
| gpt-4o-mini | Default, optimized for commits | $0.15/$0.60 | Most use cases |
| gpt-4o | Latest model, powerful | $2.50/$10.00 | Complex analysis |
| gpt-4o-2024-05-13 | Previous version | $5.00/$15.00 | Legacy support |
| gpt-3.5-turbo | Fine-tuned version | $3.00/$6.00 | Training data |

You can change the model by setting the `MODEL_NAME` environment variable. The default `gpt-4o-mini` model is recommended as it provides the best balance of cost and quality for commit message generation. It's OpenAI's most cost-efficient small model that's smarter and cheaper than GPT-3.5 Turbo.

> Note: Prices are based on OpenAI's official pricing (https://openai.com/api/pricing/). Batch API usage can provide a 50% discount but responses will be returned within 24 hours.

### Cost Management

Built-in cost optimization:
- Pre-estimates API costs
- Provides clear usage metrics
- Warns about expensive operations
- Helps optimize token usage

You can set custom warning thresholds:

```env
COST_WARNING_THRESHOLD=0.10  # Warn at ‚Ç¨0.10
```

## üìù CLI Commands

```bash
loom              # Interactive commit creation
loom analyze      # Just analyze changes
loom suggest      # Generate commit message suggestions
loom batch        # Process changes in batches
```

```env
IGNORED_PATTERNS=[
    "*.lock",
    "dist/*",
    "node_modules/*"
]
```

### Cost Thresholds

Set custom warning thresholds:

```env
COST_WARNING_THRESHOLD=0.10  # Warn at ‚Ç¨0.10
